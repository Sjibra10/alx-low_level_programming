#Bit Manipulation 

1. Bitwise AND (&): This operator performs a bitwise AND operation between two binary numbers. It sets a bit to 1 if and only if both input bits are 1.
Example:
1010
0011
> 0010

2. Bitwise OR (|): This operator performs a bitwise OR operation. It sets a bit to 1 if either or both input bits are 1.
Example:
1010
0011
> 1011

3. Bitwise XOR (^): This operator performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation. It sets a bit to 1 if exactly one of the input bits is 1.
Example:
1010
0011
> 1001

4. Bitwise NOT (~): This operator performs a bitwise NOT operation. It flips the bits; 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.
Example:
~1010
> 0101

5. t Shifting (<< and >>): These operators allow you to shift the bits left (<<) or right (>>) by a specified number of positions. This is often used for multiplication and division by powers of 2.
Example:
1010 << 2
> 0010
